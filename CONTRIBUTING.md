# Contributing
Thanks for taking the time to contribute to this dumpster fire.

Before you start though, it's important to read the [contributor code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

This project is governed by the "Contributor Covenant" code of conduct. By participating, you agree to 
uphold this covenant. Report unacceptable behaviors to [abuse@kcomain.dev](mailto:abuse@kcomain.dev).

## I've got questions.
I prefer you to contact me directly on Discord. Other methods are fine but no guarantees that I'll
respond quickly.

You can find my contact methods on my [home page](https://kcomain.dev/)

## I found some bugs.
Great! Before reporting, please check if it has already been reported. I understand the pain of having 
to go through maybe a thousand issues to report something. Therefore, if you mess up and report an 
already reported issue, nothing bad will happen.

That is if you don't abuse the system. If you happen to spam the issues list with random junk, you will
be banned.

I'll also create a pinned issue consisting a list of known issues once there are enough of them.
Please at least check them before reporting.

### Bug report requirements
Please use [this issue template.](https://github.com/kcomain/dpextras/issues/new?assignees=kcomain&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)
Please keep the template text and provide enough information on what exactly broke. This way, I could
resolve the issue quicker.

You may remove any text apart from the headings and the checklist.

### I found some security vulnerabilities!
Oh no! Please contact me **IMMEDIATELY** perferably through secure channels 
(i.e. [encrypted email](https://kcomain.dev/contact.html)).

Make sure you put [URGENT: SECURITY] in the subject, so I can respond quickly. Please.

## I've got some ideas/stuff that you can put in this.
Full of ideas? Just create [an issue](https://github.com/kcomain/dpextras/issues/new?assignees=kcomain&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) with the details. 

You should also follow the issue format as specified in [the bug report requirements.](#bug-report-requirements)

## This code is garbage!
I know. If you have any idea on how to improve this, please [make a pull request](https://github.com/kcomain/dpextras/compare).

Pull requests **should** follow the guidelines in the [codestyle](#code-style-commit-message-format) section.
Commits should be signed where possible. Unsigned commits may not be considered.

## Code style, commit message format
This project uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit 
message style. Pull requests that doesn't follow this guideline may not be considered. 

The .editorconfig file should give you a good idea on how to format the code.
